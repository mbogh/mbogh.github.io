A lot have been going on both personally and professionally so my blog has suffered :)
My lovely girlfriend **Astrid** finished her education as a **Graphic Designer** in mid June and our even lovelier daughter **Esther** is turning 2 this September.

We had just started looking for houses in the **Aalborg** when out of blue *LEGO Group* posted a new position as *Senior App Developer* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lego_careers).
Out of curiosity I read the job description and thought it sounded like my dream job, work for _LEGO_ and built stuff for iOS.

A few days later they received my application and 2 on-site interviews later they offered me the job.
![YES!]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dora-we-did-it.jpg)

Fast-forward to current day, we have bought a nice house from the year 1969 in Billund, approximately 1 km from **LEGO Innovation House**, for which we will hopefully get the keys to by the beginning of October.

The first 2 weeks at LEGO has been amazing, it is truly an awesome place to work :)
